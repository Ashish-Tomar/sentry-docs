Microsoft Teams is a hub for teamwork in Office 365. Keep all your team's chats, meetings, files, and apps together in one place. Get alerts that let you assign, ignore, and resolve issues right in your Teams channels with the Sentry integration for Microsoft Teams. 

This integration needs to set up only once per organization, then it is available for _all_ projects.

2. Press the "Add to Team" button and pick the Team you want for the integration

   You can also access **Alerts** from your **Project Settings**. From here, you can configure when notifications are sent to your Microsoft Team(s).

   You can route notifications in a few ways: to a specific channel in your Team, to multiple channels in your Team, or to multiple Teams.

4. Add your Teams channel as an action under **Perform these actions**:

   You can add Alert Rules routing to as many Microsoft Teams channels as youâ€™d like.
